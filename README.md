**Abstract**

The task of model selection governs a crucial role in the field of machine learning. However, principled Bayesian approaches normally require error-prone and time-consuming manual derivations. This paper efficiently automates Bayesian model averaging, selection and combination using message passing with scale factors. This approach allows for straightforward extension to hierarchical and temporal model priors to accommodate for modeling time-varying processes. Furthermore, we develop a novel Bayesian model combination algorithm based on gradient message passing. We validate our approach on a voice activity detection task.
